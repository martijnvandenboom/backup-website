<b>Floppy Disk Recovery Service</b>

Recovery of 5.25", 3.5" floppies and Iomega Zip Disks (super floppy) - A Voluntary Service

Do you have old floppy disks lying around with precious memories and important documents? We understand the value of these old disks, and that's why we offer a voluntary service for floppy disk recovery.

What We Offer:

Recovery of 5.25" and 3.5" floppy disks: Our team of experts has the necessary experience and technology to recover data from both 5.25" and 3.5" floppy disks. We handle disks that may have seemed lost with care and attention.

Dedicated volunteers: Our service is run by passionate volunteers committed to retrieving lost data. We understand that these disks often contain a treasure trove of personal and historical information, and we do our best to assist you.

How Does It Work?

If you're interested in our service, you can contact us via email at ingmacmvandenboom@gmail.com. Send us a message with a description of your situation and the floppy disks you want to recover. We will respond as soon as possible and work with you to find the best possible solution.

Please note: Our service is based on voluntary contributions. If we successfully recover your data and you are satisfied with the result, we appreciate any voluntary donations to support our efforts and keep the service available for others.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you are interested in recovering your floppy disks. We are here to help you preserve your precious memories.

Best regards,

Martijn
