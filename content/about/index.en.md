Dear reader,

In my academic journey, during my first year of architectural studies at the university, I encountered a subject that would forever alter the course of my life: Visual Basic programming. To my surprise, I excelled in this field, earning an impressive 9 as my grade. This achievement sharply contrasted with my performance in other subjects, where I may have barely managed a passing grade. It was a pivotal moment, an 'Eureka' experience that unequivocally pointed me in the direction I needed to pursue.

I decided to follow my passion for computers, and I switched to an Electrical Engineering program. This choice not only provided me with more opportunities to hone my software skills but also granted me a profound understanding of hardware. It was a challenge I embraced wholeheartedly, knowing it was the most demanding HBO program I could select. For me, this simply represented a greater challenge and an opportunity for personal growth.

For me, computers are not just a career; they are also my greatest hobby. I've been fortunate enough to turn my passion into my daily work. Each day, I approach my job with unwavering enthusiasm, driven by the potential for innovation and creativity, bringing both new and old ideas to life. In essence, computers are my life, and I relish every moment of this exhilarating journey.

As a continuation of my academic journey, I have a strong desire to share my experiences and insights with others. I believe in the power of sharing notes and knowledge to inspire individuals and spark innovative ideas. My aspiration is to connect with like-minded individuals and engage in meaningful conversations to exchange thoughts and viewpoints.

I firmly believe that through open communication and collaboration, we can foster a vibrant intellectual community where ideas flourish and positive change is initiated. Whether it's through online platforms, seminars, or networking events, I am eager to contribute to this exchange of knowledge and ideas. I look forward to inspiring others and being inspired in return, creating a dynamic environment where we can all learn, grow, and innovate together.

Best regards,

Martijn
