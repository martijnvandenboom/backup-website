Entering a password or PIN is not equally convenient for everyone.</br>
Do you find it annoying to enter a password or PIN every time you log in to Windows?</br>
You can also automatically log in to Windows. When the computer has finished starting up, you will immediately see the desktop.
On the desktop you can make all your useful programs accessible and you have that immediately in front of you when you have turned on the computer.
You can then immediately start using the computer, without having to enter a password or PIN first.</br>

Log in to Windows automatically:</br>
Microsoft has made a handy program especially available for this.</br>
It's called: Autologon</br>
Current version: v3.10</br>
You can download it from Microsoft at this link: https://live.sysinternals.com/Autologon.exe</br>
